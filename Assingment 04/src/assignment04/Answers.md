****Our Task was to implement a Bank System

* added an UML to understand the code better
* created the Credit cards, Customers, Bank employees and Technicians 
* used a Simpleton to generate unique ID's for the Customers and the Employees
* created an Archive where all the data is stored and a list with the 
Customers ID would be generate, so every Employee has his own Customers
* used an interface for the Bank employees and inheritance (main chief --> section chief --> regular employee)
* The customers get a random employee, because it was not clear defined in the task which customer gets which employee
* wrote unitTests for the system
