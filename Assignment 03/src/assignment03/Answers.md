The game has been implemented.
To make it easier to grade and understand we:
- Added the UML Diagram ("assignment03.uml")
- used "GameMaster" as Iterator which implemented interface "Iterator"
- used "Scoreboard" as Singleton
- used "Board" as Observer which implemented "My Observer"
- used "MilitaryShip" which implemented "MyObservable"
